# Weather Data Analysis

#  Overview

The Weather Data Analysis Project is designed to explore, analyze, and visualize historical weather patterns. Using a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, the project uncovers seasonal trends, relationships among weather variables, and anomalies in climate data.

# Workflow

  1. Data Preprocessing

    Handle missing values and duplicates
    Convert data types for analysis
    Standardize column names

  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Analyze distribution of temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
    Identify correlations among weather variables
    Detect anomalies and seasonal trends

  3. Data Visualization

    Line plots to track changes over time
    Scatter plots to show relationships between variables
    Bar charts for comparative analysis of weather conditions

  4. Insights Generation

    Highlighted seasonal patterns in temperature, humidity, and wind speed
    Detected correlations between pressure and weather conditions
    Created visual dashboards to summarize climate behavior

# Results & Insights

Identified seasonal patterns in temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Discovered correlations between pressure and weather conditions.

Built clear visual dashboards that present climate behavior over time.
